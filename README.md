# FiveM MDT

This is an unfinished MDT that was being created for a now abandoned FiveM project. Entire intent of this was to allow access externally and full integration between external users & in-game users. The basic functionality for client communication, user registration, & a basic panic system was done but pretty much anything beyond that was never gotten to.

The account system piggybacks off of Invision Power Board, so you'd have to swap that functionality either to a different service or local accounts. But beyond that it should be usable :)

Obviously because it was intended to be used externally, you'd have to run this on an external web server.
